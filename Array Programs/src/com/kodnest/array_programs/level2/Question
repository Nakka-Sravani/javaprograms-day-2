1) Copy all elements of one array into another array:

Problem: We're given an array, and we need to create a new array that contains all the elements of the original array.

Approach: We will iterate through the given array and copy each element to the new array at the same index. The new array will be of the same size as the original array.

Boiler Plate Code

Class CopyArray

{

//main method and rest of the code.

}





2)Calculate the sum of all elements in an integer array:

Problem: We're given an array of integers, and we want to find the sum of all its elements.

Approach: We will iterate through the array and add each element to a "sum" variable. By the time we've looked at every element in the array, our "sum" variable will contain the total sum of all elements in the array.
